  This note is a further attempt to model the time-dependent impact ionization seen in Run 67. We attempt to derive rates
  similar to <a href="imp_ion_model_notes.html"> Note 2</a> informed by Nick's model from 
  <a href="physical_model/physical_model.html"> Note 3 </a>.
 </p>
<p>
  We start with the processes that Nick's model assumes are dominant:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>\( e^- + D^0 \rightarrow D^- \)</li>
  <li>\( h^+ + D^- \rightarrow h^+ + e^- + D^- \)</li>
</ol>
<p> 
  Add to this ionization from ionizing radiation. Normally I would have one ionization producing an electron/hole pair,
  but as will be seen it will be useful to separate into two processes, one producing holes and one producing electrons:
</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>\( I_+ \rightarrow h^+ \)</li>
  <li>\( I_- \rightarrow e^- \)</li>
</ol>
<p> 
  Now write the rates of electron production, hole production, and the production of charged donor states in terms of the rates
  of the processes above. (We assume the 
  population of neutral donor states is constant). 
</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>\( R_h = R_+ \)</li>
  <li>\( R_e = R_- - R_{eD} + R_{hD} \)</li>
  <li>\( \dot{N}_{D-} = R_{eD} - R_{hD} \)</li>  
</ol>
<p> 
  The rates of interactions with donor states can be written as follows:  
</p>
<ol start="8">
  <li>\( R_{eD} = kR_e \)</li>
  <li>\( R_{hD} = pN{D-}R_h \)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  where \(k\) is the probability that an electron is captured by a neutral donor and \(p\) is the probability <i>per target</i> 
  that a hole impact ionizes a negatively charged donor. 
</p>
<p>
  Combining these yields 
</p>
<ol start="10">
  <li>\( \dot{N}_{D-} = \frac{k}{1+k}R_- - \frac{p}{1+k}R_+N_{D-}  \)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If we assume that the population of negative donors is initially zero, we find
</p>
<ol start="11">
  <li>\( N_{D-} = \frac{k}{p}\frac{R_-}{R_+}(1 - e^{-\frac{p}{1+k}R_+t})  \)</li>
  <li>\( \dot{N}_{D-} = \frac{k}{1+k}R_-e^{-\frac{p}{1+k}R_+t}  \)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  How well does this model fit the observations?
</p>
<ul>
  <li> As pointed out by Nick, this model correctly predicts that only holes produce the impact ionization effect, as
    evidenced by the time-dependent behavior only being present in data with positive bias. 
  <li> The model predicts that the rate of impact ionization will grow and settle exponentially to a saturation level.
    We observe initial linear growth; perhaps we don't see the phenomenon long enough to see the relaxation.
  <li> In <a href="imp_ion_model_notes.html"> Note 2</a> I tried to show how a total increase in ionization rate of 1.14 (with
    the Ba source present) could produce an increase in the growth rate of the impact ionization of 2.4. In this model the 
    growth rate should be proportional to the ionization rate, but specifically to the rate of production of electrons. Under 
    positive bias, events from the four Am sources will contribute only to the hole flux through the detector; electrons are
    immediately collected and don't flow through the bulk of the crystal. If the rate from Ba is 1.4X the rate from background,
    and if the rate from the four Am sources is 9X the rate from background, this would match the observed ratios. 
</ul>
