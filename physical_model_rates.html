  This note is an attempt at a model to explain the time-dependent behavior seen in Run 67. Specifically the observations
  we attemp to explain are
</p>
<ul>
  <li>When bias is applied to the neutralized detector, the charge collection efficiency as seen in the 60keV peak from the Am-241 source grows roughly linearly from 100% to well above 100% over a few minutes
  <li>This CCE growth is seen for hole events (Am-side of detector positively biased) and not for electron events (Am-side negatively biased)
  <li>The CCE growth rate is greater for larger applied biases, as quantified empirically in <a href="/peak_params/peak_params.html"> Note 1</a> 
  <li>The CCE growth rate is greater when the overall ionization rate is greater, due to an additional source present, 
  also quantified in <a href="/peak_params/peak_params.html"> Note 1</a>.  
</ul>
<p>
  We assume that the dominant interactions between charge carriers and impurities are those identified in 
  <a href="physical_model/physical_model.html"> Note 3 </a>:
  electrons trapping on neutral donors, and holes impacting with overcharged donors to release an electron 
  (without changing the donor charge).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>\( e^- + D^0 \rightarrow D^- \)</li>
  <li>\( h^+ + D^- \rightarrow h^+ + e^- + D^- \)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  As pointed out in <a href="physical_model/physical_model.html"> Note 3 </a>, this explains why only hole events
  produce the observed impact ionization.
</p>
<p> 
  Now add the rate of ionization from ionizing radiation. Normally I would have one ionization producing an electron/hole pair,
  but as will be seen it will be useful to separate into two processes, one producing holes and one producing electrons:
</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>\( I_+ \rightarrow h^+ \)</li>
  <li>\( I_- \rightarrow e^- \)</li>
</ol>
<p> 
  Now write the rates of electron production, hole production, and the production of charged donor states in terms of the rates
  of the processes above. (We assume the 
  population of neutral donor states is constant). 
</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>\( R_h = R_+ \)</li>
  <li>\( R_e = R_- - R_{eD} + R_{hD} \)</li>
  <li>\( \dot{N}_{D-} = R_{eD} \)</li>  
</ol>
<p> 
  The rates of interactions with donor states can be written as follows:  
</p>
<ol start="8">
  <li>\( R_{eD} = kR_e \)</li>
  <li>\( R_{hD} = pN_{D-}R_h \)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  where \(k\) is the probability that an electron is captured by a neutral donor and \(p\) is the probability <i>per target</i> 
  that a hole impact ionizes a negatively charged donor. 
</p>
<p>
  Combining these yields 
</p>
<ol start="10">
  <li>\( \dot{N}_{D-} = \frac{k}{1+k}R_- - \frac{pk}{1+k}R_+N_{D-}  \)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If we assume that the population of negative donors is initially zero, we find
</p>
<ol start="11">
  <li>\( N_{D-} = \frac{1}{p}\frac{R_-}{R_+}(1 - e^{-\frac{pk}{1+k}R_+t})  \)</li>
  <li>\( \dot{N}_{D-} = \frac{k}{1+k}R_-e^{-\frac{pk}{1+k}R_+t}  \)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  How well does this model fit the observations?
</p>
<ul>
  <li> As pointed out by Nick, this model correctly predicts that only holes produce the impact ionization effect, as
    evidenced by the time-dependent behavior only being present in data with positive bias. 
  <li> The model predicts that the rate of impact ionization will grow and settle exponentially to a saturation level.
    We observe initial linear growth; perhaps we don't see the phenomenon long enough to see the relaxation.
  <li> In <a href="imp_ion_model_notes.html"> Note 2</a> I tried to show how a total increase in ionization rate of 1.14 (with
    the Ba source present) could produce an increase in the growth rate of the impact ionization of 2.4. In this model the 
    growth rate should be proportional to the ionization rate, but specifically to the rate of production of electrons. Under 
    positive bias, events from the four Am sources will contribute only to the hole flux through the detector; electrons are
    immediately collected and don't flow through the bulk of the crystal. If the rate from Ba is 1.4X the rate from background,
    and if the rate from the four Am sources is 9X the rate from background, this would match the observed ratios. 
</ul>
<p>
  Continuing the model, we can write an expression for the gain produced by impact ionization: 
</p>
<ol start="13">
  <li>\( G = 1+pN_{D-}  \)</li>
  <li>\( \dot{G} = p\dot{N}_{D-}  \)</li>
</ol>
<p> 
  Recall \(p\) is the probability per target that a hole will produce impact ionization. For holes from Am events in 
  positive bias, they drift the entire detector thickness. So \(p\) would be the interaction cross section divided 
  by the cross-sectional area of the detector (\(A\)=78.5 cm<sup>2</sup>):
</p>
<ol start="15">
  <li>\( p = \frac{\sigma_{hD}}{A}  \)</li>
  <li>\( \dot{G} = \frac{\sigma_{hD}}{A}\dot{N}_{D-}  \)</li>
</ol>
<p> 
  Taking Nick's empirical formula from <a href="peak_params/peak_params.html"> Note 1</a> for the Am-only case, we can convert
  from keV/min to gain/s (for a 60 keV base energy) yielding 
</p>
<ol start="17">
  <li>\( \dot{G} = ge^{V/V_c} \)
</ol>
<p> 
  with \(g=3.06\times10^{-5}\) Hz, V the detector bias, and \(V_c = 1.64\) V. 
</p>    
<p> 
  If we assume \(k\) (the probability that an electron captures on a neutral donor) to be it's maximum value of 1, and consider 
  growth rate at time 0, we have from Equation 12
</p>    
</html>
<ol start="18">
  <li>\( \dot{N}_{D-} = \frac{1}{2}R_-  \)</li>
</ol>
<p> 
  so combining Equations 16, 17, and 18, 
</p>    
<ol start="19">
  <li>\( \sigma_{hD} = \frac{2Ag}{R_-}e^{V/V_c}  \)</li>
</ol>
<p> 
  In <a href="imp_ion_model_notes.html"> Note 2</a> the ionization rate was estimated at \(3\times10^6\) Hz. \(R_-\) will be 
  less than this; let's assume \(1\times10^6\) Hz. If we plug in these constants over the range in which we observe 
  impact ionization we get the following cross sections:
</p>    
<table>
  <tr><img src="model_xsection.png"></tr>
<\table>
<p> 
  These cross section values are probably too high to be plausible. The model and the observations suggest that the 
  impact ionization cross section increases with field, in contrast to the plots from Phipps shown in 
  <a href="physical_model/physical_model.html"> Note 3 </a>. So this model doesn't seem quite right, though it does 
  a better job than previous ones of matching observed behavior.
